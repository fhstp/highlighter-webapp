# ![HighLighter](https://github.com/fhstp/highlighter-webextension/raw/master/app/images/Logo_contractVis.png) Web App

Buying a product or signing up for a service implicates a contract between the consumer and the merchant or provider.
The average web user is often worried about the possible consequences from such a contract.
They are worried in particular when they interact with a new web shop or when the general terms and conditions are updated.
However, each contract involves a multitude of legal text that is hard to read and understand.

**ContractVis HighLighter** provides sophisticated text visualization support for online shopping,
yet targets non-professional users in a casual context without training.

ContractVis HighLighter consists of three components:
* a [web extension](https://github.com/fhstp/highlighter-webextension),
* a web app (this package), and
* a [backend server](https://github.com/fhstp/highlighter-backend).

## Software Frameworks Used
This project was generated with Angular CLI and includes some other features. A short list of included features is given here:
* [Angular **V6.0.3**](https://angular.io/)
* [Bootstrap **V4.1.3**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Fontawesome **V4.7.0**](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/)

## Installation and Local Development
Download the repo or clone it to your workspace.
Then navigate to the folder which includes the `package.json` and run the command `npm install`.
This will install all dependencies needed in order to develop or build this application.

## Development server
1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
2. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. 
3. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

## Build
1. Run `ng build` to build the project. 
2. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
3. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build that will minify, uglify and further optimize all files in order to make the application even faster.

## Testing (if implemented)
* Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/index.html).
* Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/).
